Hi, I'm a compiler engineer currently working with the LLVM based CPU compiler team at NVIDIA, where I have been working on various compiler technologies, including [LLVM](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project), [Numba](https://github.com/numba/numba) and [llvmlite](https://github.com/numba/llvmlite).

Before that I was at the Machine Learning and Software Engineering(MLSE) at AMD, where I was focused on improving the AMDGPU backend in LLVM. Contributing to Register allocator, GlobalIsel, Divergence/Uniformity Analysis and target specific optimisations, among other things.

Here, I try to write stuff related to compilers and software development, though I wish I could be more consistent :)
