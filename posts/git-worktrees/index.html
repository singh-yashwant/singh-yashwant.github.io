One might be the latest one(in sync with upstream), one might be for a brand new feature you are working on and the other might be some compiler crash issue that you are exploring.\nWhen I started out I thought about 2 ways of managing it:\nKeep separate repositories for all, it was easy to use but very difficult to manage (eg moving around commits in between isn’t straightforward). When you have the source of size LLVM it will quickly eat up all your memory and also looks very redundant, surely we can do better. The other option was to create separate branches. This can work but has major cons: Working on multiple branches at once is a nightmare, to say the least, we all know what happens when you try to edit files on different branches at once in an IDE. Switching can be expensive, especially for large scale projects developing rapidly and branches diverge really quickly. It’s a hassle to make sure you build to a designated directory for a branch, a bit of carelessness and you’ll end up losing a lot of time. To summarize we would like to:\nHave git branch like functionality. Easy to work on multiple features simultaneously. Clean folder structure, separate build folder associated with source. This is exactly where git worktree shines.\nLet’s understand it using LLVM source code as example.\nYou have the main source inside llvm-project. Let’s say you have to start working on a new compiler feature and very much like to keep both sources and build-directories/binaries separate.\nCreating Worktrees Run the command\ncd llvm-project git worktree add ../new-feature The above command will create a new worktree named new-feature inside new-feature folder. This new-feaure is effectively a git branch but with its own copy of source code and hence can have its own build folders. Additionally providing all functionality you have between 2 git branches (cherry-pick, merge, rebase, diff, etc).\nBelow is how the folder structure will look like after adding new-feature worktree.\nyassingh@pc ~/workstation $ ls llvm-project new-feature yassingh@pc ~/workstation $ cd llvm-project; git branch * main + new-feature You can keep going, let’s say you create another worktree for some register-allocation issue you are working on.\nyassingh@pc ~/workstation/llvm-project (main) $ git worktree add ../regalloc-issue Preparing worktree (new branch 'regalloc-issue') Updating files: 100% (127092/127092), done.
